# Volk Raycasting Tech Demo

Volk is an HTML5 raycasting tech demo using pure JavaScript and canvas.

It is similar in style to Wolfenstein 3D's engine, with no height
variance but does (will) support textures for walls and such.

The engine will be able to load map files (.volkmap extensions),
which are just plain text files which hold 2D array information.

Current version: v0.0.1-prealpha
